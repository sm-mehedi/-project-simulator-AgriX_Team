"## T-1: Implement Crop disease detection" 
"The **Crop Disease Detection** feature will be designed as a smartphone application that allows farmers to capture clear images of crop leaves using their device cameras. These images will be processed by a lightweight AI model integrated into the app to identify potential diseases in real time, ensuring quick and accessible diagnosis without requiring advanced equipment. Once a disease is detected, the system will provide easy-to-understand treatment suggestions and preventive measures, delivered in local languages so that farmers can act promptly and effectively to protect their crops."
